# DTS33A Text-to-Speech Synthesizer

This repo contains an example Python program to output speech using a DTS33A module.

To use, edit the line:

    portname = 'COM5'

Change COM5 to suit your system.

When the Python program is run, it will attempt to open that serial port, and will then play some example speech.
